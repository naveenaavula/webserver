A web server is a software application designed to serve web content to clients over a network, primarily using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Its main role is to respond to client requests by providing the requested web resources, such as HTML files, images, and other media, or returning error messages if resources cannot be accessed. Web servers listen on specific ports, typically port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS, and handle multiple requests simultaneously, either by spawning threads or using an event-driven model. They translate URLs requested by clients to file paths on the server’s storage, ensuring that only authorized files are served. When the web server receives a request, it checks the file’s existence and permissions, sends appropriate HTTP headers (like status codes and content type), and then transmits the file’s contents. Modern web servers also support HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 for optimized data transfer, with features like persistent connections. Web servers are fundamental to the World Wide Web, enabling browsers to display websites and deliver data across the Internet.
